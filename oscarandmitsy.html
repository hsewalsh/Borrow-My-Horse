       <h2>Mitzi - The School Mistress</h2>
         <p>Mitzi is a 17.1HH dark brown Dutch Warmblood mare foaled in 2000.<br>
            Mitzi is a talented mare who was bought by us in 2015 for Renaud to learn to ride on.<br>
            She had already taught her previous owner how to ride who took her eventing with much success.<br>
            Mitzi is also a talented showjumper and has even competed in the British National Amateur Finals at Aintree.<br>
            Mitzi is a no nonsense sort of character, she is excellent in traffic and likes to work hard and play hard!
