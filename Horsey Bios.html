<h2>Mitzi</h2>
<h3>The School Mistress</h3>
  <p>Mitzi is a 17.1HH dark bay Dutch Warmblood mare foaled in 2000. Mitzi is a talented mare who was bought by us in 2015 for Renaud to learn to ride on.  She had already taught her previous owner how to ride who took her eventing with much success.  Mitzi is also a talented showjumper and has even competed in the British National Amateur Finals at Aintree. Mitzi is a no nonsense sort of character, she is excellent in traffic and likes to work hard and play hard!</p>
